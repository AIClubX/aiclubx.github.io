# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## What is AI?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines programmed to think and learn like humans. The term encompasses a wide range of technologies and approaches, from rule-based systems to machine learning and deep learning.

## Core Concepts

### Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. Key approaches include:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

### Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a specialized form of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to analyze various factors of data. Common applications include:

- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Recognition

## Getting Started

To begin your AI journey, you should have a foundation in:

1. Programming (Python is recommended)
2. Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Calculus, Statistics)
3. Data Structures and Algorithms

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of a neural network in Python using TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```
